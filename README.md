My name is Karl Magnus NÃ¸kling, and I'm a Front-End Developer specializing in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And Frameworks like Bootstrap, Sass & React ( + React Native) I have completed a 2-year Front-End Development study at Noroff.

Problem-solving is my forte, and I am committed to persevering until the finished project meets my own high standards and the specific requirements of my clients. I take pride in tackling complex coding scenarios and delivering exceptional results.
